# Wikipedia TV Episode scraper

Simple scraper that pulls episode data from various TV show season web pages, so long as they follow the traditional HTML table format.

## Setup

After cloning the git repository onto your machine, make a virtual environment (install [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) if you don't have it already) for the project and install the requirements with pip:

    $ mkvirtualenv scraper
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
